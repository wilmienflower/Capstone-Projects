# Capstone-Projects
Here are all the capstone projects I've done in Level One of Software Engineering.

Poised//Company: (Java)
(ProjectPlanner/ProjectDetails/Persons)

With this project I helped an engineering company write a program where they can easily upload their new projects, update details of the customer/architect/contractor and projects.

Financial Calculator:(Python)

A program that has to do with choosing between an investment and bond, and calculates the costs that come along with it.

First Game:(Python)

It's a very short game with the goal that your player does not come in contact with the enemies but also eats the prize to win the game.

Task Manager:(Python)

A program that is office orientated. It helps a manager or "admin" add tasks and workers, and assign certain tasks to workers, allow updating of tasks and workers. It is username and password safe. The admin has more futures than the normal workers.
